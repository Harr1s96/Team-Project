* A SQL database allows the different data tables to be linked together.  It isn't the fastest database available, however; but it is long lasting.  

Google Cloud Platform (GCP):
* GCP hosts the finished product and its database.  
* The database is secured by GCP services and can only be accessed by whitelisted IPs that have the appropriate security certificates.

Firebase:
* A specific service offered by GCP that hosts the front- and back-ends of the app

Node.JS and Express:
*How the back-end works

React:
* how the front-end works

Jest, Chai, Mocha:
* Provides testing functionality

BCrypt and Passport:
* Security stuff, ask Harris

Morgan and Winston:
*Logging stuff, ask someone else

For a full list of all dependencies, please see the package.json.
